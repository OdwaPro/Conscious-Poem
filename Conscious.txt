As Above So Below 
As Within So Without
As The Universe So The Soul.
Its All Within You
You Just Have To Recognize It 
And Bring Out The Real Essence Of It.
As I Am, So You Are.!
Then we are.. .
Spirit beings dangling etween time and space...
What are we, could it be that we are just a spec
in the univrse, how do we exit...or how do we not exit?
